# Women Equality & Safety API

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
Women across the world face **safety concerns** (harassment, unsafe public transport, poorly lit areas) and **inequality** (workplace discrimination, underrepresentation in leadership, pay gaps).  

This API allows people to **report** and **track** such issues to support advocacy, policy-making, and awareness.
